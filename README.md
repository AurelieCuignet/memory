# Memory

A simple memory game in Javascript vanilla and PHP, made to test my skills.

## Installation

Clone this repository, then run `composer install` to get the needed packages.

This project uses Sass, you have to install it if you haven't already. You can install Sass globally with `npm install -g sass` or locally in the project folder with `npm install sass`.

This project uses a small database with just one table. After creating your database, just import the SQL file in _docs/_. Then, complete _app/config.ini.example_ file with your database credentiels and rename the file _config.ini_.

Just one more step: communication between frontend and backend is handled by fetch and http requests. Find the mentioned lines in the following files and update with your own URL :
* #28 in _app/Controllers/CoreController.php_: `header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://your.url.here");`
* #2 in _assets/js/api.js_: `apiRootUrl: 'https://your.url.here',`

It would be better to have a dedicated config file for these, I might take care of this later 🙃

## Use

You can try this game live and play a bit [here](https://memory.kyborash.com/). It's only available in French for now, it might be translated in the future.

Hope you'll enjoy it, have fun ! 😊

## Future upgrades

This project is not mobile-friendly yet (what a shame, I know...). I plan to fix this in the future 🙏 In the meantime, you'll have a better experiment on desktop 🖥️ / laptop 💻

Rounds per game and matching cards are tracked in the game but not saved for now. Next version of the game will add these to the scores in DB, and use them to order high scores.
